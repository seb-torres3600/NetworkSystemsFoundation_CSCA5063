Welcome! Throughout this course, Network Systems Foundations, you will delve into the fundamental layers of network communication. You will start with a thorough discussion of the Link Layer and its crucial role, moving on to the intricacies of Internet Protocol (IP) and router data planes, and then navigate through the complexities of the transport layer, application layer, and network security. With a practical focus, you'll write Python code to manage routing tables, analyze network traffic, simulate router functionalities, and create digital certificates for web servers. By the end of this course, you will have a well-rounded understanding of networking principles, from data transmission and routing to application protocols and security, and will be equipped with practical skills to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of network technology.

By completing this course, learners will be able to: 

1.	Describe the layers in depth and how they relate to one another
2.	Analyze traffic through python programming
3.	Design a simplified routing protocol that has similar features as to what powers the Internet
4.	Create a client and server with socket programming
5.	Generate certificates for TLS which powers the security in https

This course is being taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulderâ€™s MS in Computer Science degrees offered on the Coursera platform.
